Drowning in data

Challenge

## Scattered Everywhere

The current workflow is a chaotic web of disconnected tools with no central organization.

Design teams waste 30% of time searching for information across disconnected systems where insights slip through the cracks

Spreadsheet formats lack consistency across feedback channels.

<!-- image -->

Slack conversations quickly scroll away without proper tracking.

<!-- image -->

Email threads remain untagged and difficult to reference.

Meeting notes get buried across various applications.

Survey results exist isolated in separate platforms.
