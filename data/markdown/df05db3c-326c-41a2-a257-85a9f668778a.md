# DocuSearch Test Document

## Overview

This is a test document for validating the DocuSearch end-to-end processing pipeline.

## Features Being Tested

1. **Document Upload** - File upload via frontend/webhook
2. **Status Tracking** - Real-time processing status updates
3. **Embedding Generation** - ColPali multimodal embeddings
4. **ChromaDB Storage** - Vector database persistence
5. **Frontend UI** - Document library and status display

## Test Content

This document contains sufficient text content to generate meaningful embeddings and validate the text processing pipeline.

### Section A: Introduction

Document processing involves multiple stages including parsing, embedding generation, and storage. This test validates each stage.

### Section B: Technical Details

The system uses:

- ColPali for multimodal embeddings
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- FastAPI for the backend
- React + TypeScript for the frontend

## Conclusion

This test document should process successfully and appear in the document library with completed status.
