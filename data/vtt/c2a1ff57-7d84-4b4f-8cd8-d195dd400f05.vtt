NOTE Generated from Myth 2.mp3

1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.780
Myth 2. Some people are just creative by nature.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.720
As a creative person, people have probably told you that you were naturally gifted with creativity.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.020
Creative things often come easy to you, so you probably believed them.

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.640
Then, when you reached a plateau in your skills, you might have thought,

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.720
I guess that's as good as I am.

6
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.800
While taking music lessons as a kid,

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.120
I'd catch on to things more quickly than some of the other students.

8
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.100
Often teachers would say things like,

9
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.040
you'll get this pretty easy, you're doing great,

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.060
or looks like natural talent there, or something similar.

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.820
This course led me to believe that I did in fact have a natural-born talent.

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520
My mom played guitar and sang and wrote songs.

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.240
I must get my talent from her.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.840
This led to frustration when things didn't come easy,

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.980
when things didn't feel natural,

16
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.100
when I actually had to work at things,

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.520
I'd give up, assuming I'd hit the limit of my talent,

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.620
and move on to the next thing that came easily.

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.500
Years later, after continually playing,

20
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.580
I noticed the chords I couldn't play before were now simple.

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.620
The notes I couldn't reach when singing now had power and clarity.

22
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.360
I learned that the more I did something,

23
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.840
the better I got.

24
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.020
The truth is,

25
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.460
every single person is born creative,

26
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.420
and stays creative throughout their life.

27
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.160
It's just some people practice more.

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.520
Some people exercise their curiosity more.

29
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.780
If you feel like you've hit a plateau,

30
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.360
or like you've used up your creative potential,

31
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.120
I'm here to tell you

32
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.380
that you have a limitless well

33
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.100
ready to explore.

34
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.360
Exercise.

35
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.200
Explore your past and current creativity.

36
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.120
What kind of things did you enjoy doing as a kid?

37
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
What did you like most about these things?

38
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.400
Are there any specific memories you have of doing art,

39
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.960
or music,

40
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.980
or other creative things as a kid?

41
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.160
What are the things you enjoy doing now?

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.040
What comes to mind when I ask the question,

43
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.560
what creative project do you want to work on most?

44
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.880
Now,

45
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.220
do the things from your childhood list

46
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220
and your list of current interests

47
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.360
have anything in common?

48
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.340
Is there a way you could combine them at all?
