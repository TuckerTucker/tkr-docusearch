Myth 3. The Creative Hermit. When you think of a creative genius, what do you picture? The lone artist holed up in a cramped studio slaving away for weeks on end and neglecting their friends and family? Dr. Frankenstein working in his castle all alone? The writer at the typewriter with a bottle of booze to keep them company? These are all tropes and stereotypes. While it is important to spend time by ourselves while creating, it's equally as important to balance that creation time with just plain old life. Edison, inventor of the light bulb, had a team of engineers working with him. Snow White, Disney's first animated feature-length film, was designed... Edison, inventor of the light bulb, had a team of engineers working with him. Snow White, Disney's first animated feature-length film, was designed and drawn by nine artists. The famous violin maker Stradivarius was a workshop of a dozen or more artisans and apprentices. As you look through history, you'll find that some of the greatest pieces of art and creativity came with a lot of support.

came with a lot of support. In her book, The Art of Asking, Amanda Palmer talks about the famous author Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden. Now, this is where I cheat a bit because I'm just going to read a short passage from her book because she can write about this much nicer than I can. And then we'll go on to talk about my mom. Okay, here we go. Thoreau wrote in painstaking detail about how he chose to remove himself from society to live by his own means in a little 10-foot by 15-foot hand-hewn cabin on the side of a pond. What he left out of Walden, though, was the fact that the land he built on was borrowed from his wealthy neighbor. That his pal, Ralph Waldo Emerson, had him over for dinner all the time and that every Sunday, Thoreau's mother and sister brought over a basket of freshly baked goods for him, including donuts. The idea of Thoreau, gazing thoughtfully over the expanse of transcendental Walden Pond, a bluebird alighting onto his threadbare shoe, all the while eating donuts that his mom brought him, just doesn't jibe with most folks' picture of him as a self-relied, noble, marrow-sucking, back-to-the-woods folk hero. Now, like I promised, on to my mom. My mom has been writing songs for over 40 years, and one of

while eating donuts that his mom brought him, just doesn't jibe with most folks' picture of him as a self-relied, noble, marrow-sucking, back-to-the-woods folk hero. Now, like I promised, on to my mom. My mom has been writing songs for over 40 years, and one of the most important parts of being a songwriter for her was being part of songwriting groups, whether she joined them or started them. She has continually had a community of songwriters to keep her motivated over the years. Exercise. Find your tribe. Make a list of other creative friends you can reach out to to help keep your spark going. Are there any groups in your town specific to your creative pursuits that you could join? Are there any online groups that could be a supportive community? Are you ready to ask for support from your friends and family to help give you the time and space you need to complete your project? If not, what would you need to make happen for you to be ready? Does that feel, or is it? to go for the exit.
