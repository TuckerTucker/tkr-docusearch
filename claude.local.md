# When writing code:
Ensure modularity, extensibility and testability by following Inversion of Control (IoC) design principles. Implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) through a shared core architecture:
- Consolidate business logic and utilities in a core library
- Build interfaces (APIs, MCP, tools, etc.) that import from the core
- Extract duplicated functionality to appropriate core module
- Keep interfaces thin and focused on their specific responsibilities

## Python:

Use:
- PEP 8 coding conventions
- PEP 337 logging standards, including logging statements to capture important events, such as the start and end of each function, and any errors or exceptions that occur.
- PEP 484 Type Hints conventions.
- Docstrings follow Google Styleguide

## When writing commit messages
- Do not add the Claude code footer to commit messages.
- remove the 'generated with ...' and 'co-authored ...' messages if they are present.

!! IMPORTANT Always run scripts from the project root !!
