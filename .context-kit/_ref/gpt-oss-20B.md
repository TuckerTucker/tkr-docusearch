I'll search for information about running gpt-oss with MLX on Mac M1 natively.Let me search for more specific information about the native MLX setup requirements.Based on my research, here's what's required to run gpt-oss using MLX natively on a Mac M1 without third-party tools like LM Studio or Ollama:

## Hardware Requirements
- **Mac M1** (or newer M-series chip: M2, M3, M4)
- At least 16GB of RAM for the gpt-oss-20b model
- Around 13GB of RAM is needed for running the model
- For the larger 120b model, you'll need significantly more memory

## Software Requirements

### 1. Install MLX and mlx-lm
You need MLX-LM version 0.26.3 or later for gpt_oss support

```bash
pip install mlx-lm
```

### 2. Download the Model
You can download MLX-optimized versions from Hugging Face. There are quantized versions available:

```bash
# Using Hugging Face CLI
pip install huggingface-hub

# Download the model (example with 4-bit quantized version)
huggingface-cli download InferenceIllusionist/gpt-oss-20b-MLX-4bit --local-dir ./gpt-oss-20b-MLX-4bit
```

Or download the 8-bit version:
```bash
huggingface-cli download lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-MLX-8bit --local-dir ./gpt-oss-20b-MLX-8bit
```

### 3. Run the Model
Here's basic Python code to run inference:

```python
from mlx_lm import load, generate

# Load the quantized model
model, tokenizer = load("./gpt-oss-20b-MLX-4bit")

# Generate text
prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms:"
response = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, max_tokens=512)
print(response)
```

## Important Notes
- The model uses the gpt_oss architecture which is only supported in MLX-LM v0.26.3+
- Models should be used with the harmony response format for proper functionality
- Performance may vary depending on your specific M1 configuration (base, Pro, Max, or Ultra)

This gives you a completely native setup without needing LM Studio, Ollama, or any other third-party applications!
