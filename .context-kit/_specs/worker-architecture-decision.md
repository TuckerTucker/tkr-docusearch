# Worker Architecture Decision: worker.py vs worker_webhook.py

**Agent**: worker-decision-agent (Wave 4)
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: ANALYSIS COMPLETE - RECOMMENDATION PROVIDED

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: DOCUMENT AS ALTERNATIVE MODE** (Option B)

Both worker implementations serve valid use cases and should be maintained:
- **worker_webhook.py**: Production-ready HTTP webhook mode (default, recommended)
- **worker.py**: Watchdog mode for standalone/development use cases

**Key Finding**: worker.py was actively maintained (last modified 2025-10-13), indicating ongoing support. Rather than deprecating, we should document both modes clearly and establish when to use each.

---

## Analysis Findings

### 1. Git History Analysis

**worker.py Recent Activity**:
```
d536c5c - 2025-10-13 - fix(worker): sync legacy worker supported formats with webhook worker
4342d31 - 2025-10-07 - feat(multi-format): add support for 21 document formats
46b294f - 2025-10-06 - fix(worker): use DocumentProcessor correctly
dc8c2f2 - 2025-10-06 - fix(worker): correct parser method name
b6adc8f - 2025-10-06 - feat(wave4): complete 100% production-ready system
```

**worker_webhook.py Recent Activity**:
```
bfca3f9 - 2025-10-14 - refactor(wave3): consolidate configuration management via ProcessingConfig
46f12e0 - 2025-10-14 - feat(processing): consolidate file validation - Waves 1-2 complete
d536c5c - 2025-10-13 - fix(worker): sync legacy worker supported formats with webhook worker
```

**Analysis**:
- worker.py is **actively maintained** (modified within last 24 hours)
- Commit message "sync legacy worker supported formats" indicates intention to keep in sync
- Both workers received the same validation logic updates (file_validator integration)
- No evidence of deprecation plans

**Conclusion**: worker.py is not abandoned legacy code—it's being actively maintained in parallel.

---

### 2. Usage Analysis

#### Current Production Usage

**Docker Compose** (`docker/docker-compose.yml`):
- Container CMD: `python3 -m src.processing.worker_webhook`
- **Default mode**: webhook (worker_webhook.py)

**Management Scripts**:
- `scripts/start-all.sh`: Launches worker_webhook.py (native mode)
- `scripts/run-worker-native.sh`: Runs worker_webhook.py
- No scripts reference worker.py

**Documentation** (`docs/QUICK_START.md`):
- References webhook-based processing
- No mention of watchdog mode

**Conclusion**: worker_webhook.py is the **production default** and recommended mode.

#### Potential worker.py Use Cases

While not currently scripted, worker.py (watchdog mode) has valid use cases:

1. **Standalone Development**:
   - Running without Docker
   - No copyparty webhook infrastructure
   - Simple file-drop workflow

2. **Local Testing**:
   - Testing document processing in isolation
   - No need for full Docker stack

3. **Alternative Deployment**:
   - Environments without HTTP webhook support
   - Network-isolated processing
   - Simple directory-based workflows

4. **Backup Processing Mode**:
   - Fallback if webhook system fails
   - Recovery processing for failed uploads

### 3. Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | worker.py (Watchdog) | worker_webhook.py (Webhook) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Trigger** | File system events (watchdog) | HTTP POST webhook |
| **Dependencies** | watchdog library | FastAPI, uvicorn |
| **Port** | None (no network) | 8002 (HTTP API) |
| **Status API** | Basic function | Full REST API + WebSocket |
| **Monitoring** | Log-based | Real-time WebSocket updates |
| **Integration** | Standalone | Copyparty webhook integration |
| **Startup** | Direct Python execution | Uvicorn server |
| **Scalability** | Single process | Async + thread pool |
| **Features** | Document processing only | + Status API + WebSocket + Documents API |
| **Production Ready** | Yes | Yes (more features) |
| **Code Size** | ~318 lines | ~747 lines |
| **Complexity** | Lower | Higher (more features) |
| **Last Updated** | 2025-10-13 | 2025-10-14 |
| **Active Maintenance** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**Key Differences**:

1. **Trigger Mechanism**:
   - Watchdog: Monitors directory, triggers on file creation
   - Webhook: Waits for HTTP POST from copyparty

2. **Feature Set**:
   - Watchdog: Core processing only
   - Webhook: Processing + REST API + WebSocket + monitoring

3. **Use Case**:
   - Watchdog: Simple, standalone
   - Webhook: Integrated, production

**Shared Components** (Both use):
- ColPaliEngine (embeddings)
- ChromaClient (storage)
- DocumentProcessor (processing)
- DoclingParser (parsing)
- ProcessingConfig (configuration)
- file_validator (validation)

---

### 4. Code Duplication Analysis

**Duplicate Logic** (~200 lines):
- Document processing loop
- Status tracking
- Error handling
- Logging setup
- Component initialization

**Unique to worker.py**:
- Watchdog event handler (57 lines)
- Directory scanning for existing files (17 lines)

**Unique to worker_webhook.py**:
- FastAPI application setup (106 lines)
- REST API endpoints (180 lines)
- WebSocket support (27 lines)
- Background task processing (161 lines)
- Enhanced monitoring (50+ lines)

**Shared via Imports**:
- file_validator (validation logic) ✅
- ProcessingConfig (configuration) ✅
- Core processing components ✅

**Conclusion**: Recent refactoring (Wave 1-3) already eliminated most duplication. Remaining duplication is architectural (each mode needs its own trigger mechanism).

---

### 5. Technical Debt Status

From `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`:

> ### 2. Two Worker Implementations
> **Issue**: Two separate worker implementations for different modes
> **Problem**: Duplicate code, unclear which is "official"
> **Questions to Answer**:
> - Is watchdog mode still needed? ✅ **YES** (actively maintained)
> - Are there use cases for directory watching? ✅ **YES** (standalone, dev)
> - Can we merge both modes? ❌ **NO** (different architectures)

**Updated Assessment**:
- Both workers now use shared validation (file_validator)
- Both workers now use ProcessingConfig
- Duplication reduced from ~40 lines to architectural minimums
- Clear production default (webhook) established

---

## Recommendation: DOCUMENT AS ALTERNATIVE MODE

### Rationale

1. **Active Maintenance**: worker.py received updates within 24 hours (2025-10-13)
2. **Valid Use Cases**: Standalone mode, development, backup processing
3. **Low Duplication**: Recent refactoring eliminated most duplication
4. **Architectural Differences**: Each mode has fundamentally different trigger mechanisms
5. **Code Synchronization**: Commit messages show intent to keep both in sync

### Action Plan

#### Phase 1: Documentation (Priority: HIGH)

**Create**: `docs/WORKER_MODES.md`

Contents:
- Architecture comparison (watchdog vs webhook)
- When to use each mode
- Setup instructions for both modes
- Feature matrix
- Migration guide (if switching modes)

**Update**: `docs/QUICK_START.md`

Add section:
```markdown
## Worker Modes

DocuSearch supports two processing modes:

1. **Webhook Mode (Recommended)**: HTTP-based processing triggered by copyparty
   - Full Docker integration
   - REST API + WebSocket monitoring
   - Production deployment
   - Setup: `./scripts/start-all.sh`

2. **Watchdog Mode**: File system-based processing for standalone use
   - No Docker required (can run locally)
   - Simpler architecture
   - Development and testing
   - Setup: `python -m src.processing.worker`

See [WORKER_MODES.md](./WORKER_MODES.md) for detailed comparison.
```

**Update**: `README.md` (if exists)

Add worker mode comparison to architecture section.

#### Phase 2: Script Support (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Create**: `scripts/run-worker-watchdog.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run worker in watchdog mode (standalone, no webhook)

# Similar to run-worker-native.sh but runs worker.py instead
python3 -m src.processing.worker
```

**Update**: `scripts/start-all.sh`

Add `--watchdog` flag option:
```bash
# Start in watchdog mode (no webhook)
./scripts/start-all.sh --watchdog
```

#### Phase 3: Docker Support (Priority: LOW)

**Create**: `docker/docker-compose.watchdog.yml` (override file)

Changes:
- Remove copyparty service
- Mount uploads directory as read-write
- Run worker.py instead of worker_webhook.py

#### Phase 4: Update Technical Debt Document

**Update**: `.context-kit/_specs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`

Move item #2 to "Resolved":
```markdown
### 2. Two Worker Implementations
**Resolved**: 2025-10-14
**Solution**: Documented both modes as complementary architectures. Created WORKER_MODES.md comparison guide. Both modes actively maintained for different use cases.

**Decision**: KEEP BOTH
- worker_webhook.py: Production default (Docker + webhook)
- worker.py: Standalone mode (development, testing, backup)

**Files Changed**:
- Created: `docs/WORKER_MODES.md` (comparison guide)
- Updated: `docs/QUICK_START.md` (mode selection)
- Created: `scripts/run-worker-watchdog.sh` (startup script)

**Impact**:
- ✅ Clear guidance on mode selection
- ✅ Both modes documented and supported
- ✅ Production default clearly established
- ✅ Reduced confusion about "which worker"
```

### WORKER_MODES.md Structure

```markdown
# DocuSearch Worker Modes

## Overview
Two processing architectures for different deployment scenarios.

## Comparison Table
[Feature matrix from section 3 above]

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use Webhook Mode If:
- Running full Docker stack
- Using copyparty for uploads
- Need REST API or WebSocket monitoring
- Production deployment
- Want automatic processing on upload

### Use Watchdog Mode If:
- Running locally without Docker
- Simple file-drop workflow
- Development and testing
- No network infrastructure needed
- Want standalone processing

## Setup Instructions

### Webhook Mode (Default)
[Existing setup from QUICK_START.md]

### Watchdog Mode
[New setup instructions]

## Migration Guide
[How to switch between modes]

## Architecture Details
[Technical comparison]

## FAQ
[Common questions]
```

## Alternative Considered (Deprecation)

### Why NOT Deprecate worker.py

**Against Deprecation**:
1. ✅ Active maintenance (updated 24 hours ago)
2. ✅ Valid use cases (standalone, development)
3. ✅ Low maintenance burden (shared components)
4. ✅ Different architecture (not redundant)
5. ✅ No evidence of problems or bugs

**Deprecation would require**:
- Migration guide for watchdog users
- Alternative for non-webhook deployments
- Removing 318 lines of working code
- Losing simpler deployment option

**Conclusion**: Deprecation not justified given active maintenance and valid use cases.

## Migration Guide (Not Needed)

Since we're **documenting rather than deprecating**, no migration is required. Both modes remain supported.

For users wanting to **switch modes**:

**From Webhook to Watchdog**:
1. Stop webhook worker: `./scripts/stop-all.sh`
2. Run watchdog worker: `python3 -m src.processing.worker`
3. Drop files in uploads directory

**From Watchdog to Webhook**:
1. Stop watchdog worker: `Ctrl+C`
2. Start webhook stack: `./scripts/start-all.sh`
3. Upload files via copyparty UI (localhost:8000)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Wave 4)
1. ✅ Create this decision document
2. Create WORKER_MODES.md
3. Update QUICK_START.md
4. Update TECHNICAL_DEBT.md

### Short-term (Post-Wave 4)
1. Create run-worker-watchdog.sh script
2. Add --watchdog flag to start-all.sh
3. Test both modes in CI/CD

### Long-term (v2.0)
1. Consider unified worker with pluggable triggers
2. Evaluate if both modes still needed
3. Gather usage metrics
