## Support

### Debugging Tips
1. **No sync happening?** â†’ Check console for error messages
2. **Audio won't play?** â†’ Check browser auto-play policy
3. **VTT not showing?** â†’ Verify `metadata.vtt_available === true`
4. **Slideshow not loading?** â†’ Check page data in API response
5. **Accordion empty?** â†’ Check chunks array in API response

### Log Inspection
```bash
# Watch worker logs
tail -f logs/worker-native.log

# Check processing status
curl http://localhost:8002/status

# Check document API
curl http://localhost:8002/documents/34ac0b91-3ed8-4fea-9580-eef9d1cc842c
```
