# Markdown Storage + Audio Processing Orchestration

**Status**: Ready for Execution
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Features**: Full markdown storage + MP3/WAV audio processing with Whisper ASR
**Agents**: 6 parallel agents
**Estimated Time**: 12-17 hours development, 8-10 hours elapsed (with parallelism)

## Quick Start

### For Orchestrator/Lead Developer

1. **Review the plan**:
   ```bash
   cat orchestration-plan.md | less
   ```

2. **Check prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   bash ../../../scripts/check-prerequisites.sh  # Create this from validation-strategy.md
   ```

3. **Launch Wave 1**:
   ```bash
   # Start both agents in parallel
   # Agent 1: Implement compression functions
   # Agent 2: Implement ASR configuration
   ```

4. **Monitor progress**:
   ```bash
   python ../../../scripts/check-wave-status.py --wave 1
   ```

### For Individual Agents

1. **Find your assignment**:
   - Open `agent-assignments.md`
   - Search for your agent name
   - Read your territory, responsibilities, and dependencies

2. **Read your contracts**:
   - Check `integration-contracts/` for your provider/consumer contracts
   - Understand exactly what you must deliver

3. **Update status**:
   ```bash
   python ../../../scripts/update-agent-status.py your-agent-name in_progress "Starting work" 0
   ```

4. **Work independently**:
   - Stay within your territory
   - Follow your interface contract
   - Write tests as you go
   - Update status frequently

5. **Report blockers**:
   ```bash
   # Create blocker file if needed
   cp blockers/template.md blockers/your-agent-blocker-001.md
   # Fill in details
   ```

6. **Complete and validate**:
   ```bash
   # Run your tests
   pytest src/path/to/your/tests/

   # Update status
   python ../../../scripts/update-agent-status.py your-agent-name completed "All tests passing" 100
   ```

## Wave Summary

### Wave 0: Prerequisites (30 min)
- Check ffmpeg installed
- Check docling[asr] dependencies
- Create directory structure
- Review all contracts

### Wave 1: Foundation (2-3 hours, parallel)
- **compression-agent**: Implement compress/decompress markdown
- **config-asr-agent**: Implement AsrConfig dataclass
- **Gate**: Both agents complete, tests pass

### Wave 2: Parser Integration (3-4 hours, parallel with coordination)
- **parser-markdown-agent**: Extract markdown in parser
- **parser-asr-agent**: Add ASR pipeline configuration
- **Gate**: Both agents complete, no conflicts, tests pass

### Wave 3: Storage & Testing (3-4 hours, parallel)
- **storage-markdown-agent**: Add markdown compression to storage
- **testing-integration-agent**: Create comprehensive test suites
- **Gate**: Storage works, tests created and passing

### Wave 4: Integration Validation (2-3 hours, coordinated)
- **testing-integration-agent** (lead): Run end-to-end tests
- **All agents**: Cross-agent code reviews
- **Gate**: All integration tests pass, performance targets met

### Wave 5: Documentation (1-2 hours)
- Update README, QUICK_START, create AUDIO_PROCESSING.md
- **Gate**: Documentation complete and reviewed

## Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent knows exactly what files they own
2. **Interface Contracts**: Specifications defined before implementation
3. **Progressive Validation**: Test after each wave, not at the end
4. **Frequent Communication**: Update status daily, report blockers immediately
5. **Independent Work**: Agents work in parallel without blocking each other
6. **Synchronized Integration**: All agents meet at wave gates for validation

---

## What Makes This Orchestration Work

### Territorial Ownership
- No file conflicts (agents own different files or different sections)
- Clear responsibility (one agent per deliverable)
- No ambiguity (contracts specify exactly what each agent provides)

### Interface-First Development
- Contracts written before code
- Providers know what to deliver
- Consumers know what to expect
- Integration "just works" when contracts followed

### Progressive Validation
- Test after every wave (not at the end)
- Catch integration issues early
- Validate performance continuously
- No big-bang integration surprise

### Maximum Parallelism
- Wave 1: 2 agents work simultaneously (100% parallel)
- Wave 2: 2 agents work simultaneously (100% parallel)
- Wave 3: 2 agents work simultaneously (100% parallel)
- Wave 4: Coordinated validation (necessary serialization)
- **Result**: ~40-50% time savings from parallelism

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"
→ Read `agent-assignments.md`, find your agent, read your responsibilities and contracts

### "I'm blocked by another agent"
→ Check their status file in `status/`, create a blocker file in `blockers/`

### "I have a question about the interface"
→ Create a question file in `questions/`, reference the integration contract

### "I found a conflict in the codebase"
→ Check `agent-assignments.md` for territorial boundaries, follow conflict resolution in `coordination-protocol.md`

### "My tests are failing"
→ Check `validation-strategy.md` for test specifications, ensure you're following the contract

### "I'm done, what's next?"
→ Update status to `completed`, run validation checklist, wait for wave gate to proceed

---

## Monitoring & Dashboards

### Check Overall Progress
```bash
# Check all agent statuses
ls -lh status/

# Check specific wave
python ../../../scripts/check-wave-status.py --wave 1

# Check for blockers
ls -lh blockers/

# Check for questions
ls -lh questions/
```

### Generate Progress Report
```bash
# (To be implemented)
python ../../../scripts/generate-progress-report.py
```

## Post-Mortem

After completion, conduct a retrospective:

### What Went Well
- Which agents completed on time?
- Which interfaces worked perfectly?
- What coordination practices helped?

### What Could Improve
- Which blockers took longest to resolve?
- Which contracts were ambiguous?
- What would you do differently?

### Lessons Learned
- Document for future orchestrations
- Update templates and protocols
- Share with team
