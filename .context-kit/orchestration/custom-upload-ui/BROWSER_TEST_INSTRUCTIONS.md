# Browser Testing Instructions

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Ready for Testing
**Services**: All running (ChromaDB, Copyparty, Worker with UI and Status API)

## Services Status

‚úÖ All services are running:
- **Upload UI (Copyparty)**: http://localhost:8000
- **ChromaDB**: http://localhost:8001
- **Worker API**: http://localhost:8002
- **Custom Upload UI**: http://localhost:8002/ui/
- **Status API**: http://localhost:8002/status/queue

## Pre-Flight Checks ‚úÖ

1. **Status API**: ‚úÖ Working - returns empty queue: `{"queue": [], "total": 0, "active": 0, "completed": 0, "failed": 0}`
2. **UI Static Files**: ‚úÖ Serving - index.html accessible at http://localhost:8002/ui/
3. **Worker Health**: ‚úÖ Healthy
4. **Route Ordering**: ‚úÖ Fixed - `/queue` endpoint now comes before `/{doc_id}` to avoid conflicts
