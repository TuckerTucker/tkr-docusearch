## Contract Change Management

### Minor Change (No Breaking Changes)
**Examples**: Clarify wording, add example, improve comments

**Process**:
1. Author updates contract with `[UPDATED - v1.1]` tag
2. Post notice in status.md: "IC-00X updated (minor)"
3. Dependent agents acknowledge within 1 hour
4. No re-approval needed

---

### Major Change (Breaking Changes)
**Examples**: Change function signature, modify data structure, alter behavior

**Process**:
1. Author proposes change with `[PROPOSAL - v2.0]` tag in contract file
2. Post detailed explanation in issues.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Issue #[N]: Contract Change Proposal - IC-00X
   - **Proposed By**: [Agent Name]
   - **Reason**: [why change is needed]
   - **Impact**: [which agents/files affected]
   - **Alternative Considered**: [if any]
   - **Approval Needed From**: [list of dependent agents]
   ```
3. All dependent agents review and comment
4. If approved by all:
   - Update contract with `[APPROVED - v2.0]` tag
   - Notify all dependent agents
   - Dependent agents update implementations
   - May delay gate transition
5. If rejected:
   - Discuss alternatives
   - Find compromise solution
   - Repeat process

**Escalation**: If consensus can't be reached, escalate to orchestration lead

---

## Code Review Protocol

### Backend Code Review
**Reviewer**: Frontend Implementation Agent (consumer perspective)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Function signatures match IC-001, IC-002
- [ ] Error handling follows contract
- [ ] Logging adequate for debugging
- [ ] Type hints and docstrings present
- [ ] Test coverage comprehensive
- [ ] No obvious bugs or edge case issues
- [ ] Performance acceptable

**Process**:
1. Backend Impl Agent posts: "Backend code ready for review"
2. Frontend Impl Agent reviews within 2 hours
3. Frontend Impl Agent posts review in contract-reviews.md
4. If changes requested, Backend Impl Agent fixes and re-submits
5. If approved, Backend Impl Agent proceeds to Gate 2

---

### Frontend Code Review
**Reviewer**: Backend Implementation Agent (producer perspective)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Uses API response correctly per IC-004
- [ ] Native track element implemented per IC-005
- [ ] Error handling for missing VTT
- [ ] Backward compatibility for null timestamps
- [ ] Code cleaner (markdown parsing removed)
- [ ] No obvious UI bugs
- [ ] Test page demonstrates functionality

**Process**:
1. Frontend Impl Agent posts: "Frontend code ready for review"
2. Backend Impl Agent reviews within 2 hours
3. Backend Impl Agent posts review in contract-reviews.md
4. If changes requested, Frontend Impl Agent fixes and re-submits
5. If approved, Frontend Impl Agent proceeds to Gate 2

## Conflict Resolution

### File Conflict (Should Never Happen)
With territorial ownership, file conflicts should never occur. If they do:

1. **Stop immediately** - both agents pause work
2. **Document conflict** in issues.md with CRITICAL severity
3. **Review territory assignments** - identify where boundaries were unclear
4. **Clarify ownership** - update agent-assignments.md
5. **Resolve conflict** - owner keeps their changes, other agent adapts
6. **Update protocol** - improve territoriality to prevent recurrence

---

### Dependency Conflict
**Example**: Frontend agent needs backend feature not yet implemented

**Process**:
1. Frontend agent posts in issues.md: "Dependency Issue"
2. Backend agent prioritizes the needed feature
3. Frontend agent continues with other tasks or creates mock/stub
4. Once backend feature ready, frontend agent integrates
5. Mark issue resolved

---

### Performance Conflict
**Example**: Backend implementation too slow for frontend requirements

**Process**:
1. Frontend agent measures and documents performance issue
2. Post in issues.md with performance benchmarks
3. Backend agent investigates optimization options
4. If optimization possible: implement and re-test
5. If not possible: negotiate revised performance contract
6. Update IC-002 or other contracts if thresholds change

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Bug Found
1. Agent discovering bug posts CRITICAL issue immediately
2. All affected agents stop work on affected components
3. Team discusses root cause and solution
4. Assign owner to fix
5. Test fix thoroughly before resuming work
6. May require contract revision or wave rollback

### Gate Failure
1. Agent running gate checklist identifies failure
2. Post failed checklist with details of what failed
3. Identify root cause (code bug, test issue, contract mismatch)
4. Assign owner to fix
5. Re-run gate checklist once fixed
6. Do not proceed to next wave until gate passes

### Rollback Procedure
If Wave 3 integration testing fails catastrophically:

1. **Frontend rollback**: Revert audio-player.js and accordion.js changes
   - Restore markdown parsing code
   - System returns to working state

2. **Backend preserved**: Keep timestamp extraction improvements
   - Data structure improved even if frontend doesn't use yet
   - Can retry frontend integration later

3. **Analysis phase**: Document what went wrong
   - Update integration contracts based on findings
   - Plan fixes before retry

4. **Retry**: Re-execute Wave 2 (frontend only) or Wave 3 with fixes
