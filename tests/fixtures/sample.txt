Test Text File
==============

This is a sample plain text file for testing the document processing pipeline.

Section 1: Overview
-------------------
Plain text files are processed as text-only documents. They do not generate
page images or visual embeddings.

Section 2: Content
------------------
The content should be chunked based on the configured chunk size and overlap
settings. Each chunk will receive a text embedding for semantic search.

Testing Notes:
- Text files use simple chunking without structure extraction
- No visual embeddings are generated
- Metadata includes filename and chunk position
- Expected chunks: 1-2 depending on chunk size settings

Keywords for search testing:
text processing, plain text, semantic search, chunking, embeddings
