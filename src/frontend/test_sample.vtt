Myth 1. Ideas come in a flash.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.040
Ideas may feel like they come in a flash, but it's actually after your brain has done a lot of work.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.100
If you get frustrated and can't seem to figure out a certain problem or get past a certain limitation in your understanding,

4
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.560
moving to a break state can actually help your brain work on it.

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.280
That's where walking away and taking a shower can help.

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.760
This is also why sleeping on a problem

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.240
And the best way to use this mode of thinking is to first do

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.960
focused mode work on the problem before letting your brain wander.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160
Otherwise, you have nothing to diffuse.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.520
Diffuse mode thinking can also help you avoid Einstellung, German for mindset.

11
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.840
This is where you can't solve a problem

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.640
because you're stuck seeing it only through the lens of a prior idea.

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.360
Allowing your brain to wander, even for just a short while,

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.200
can help you come at a problem from a new angle.
